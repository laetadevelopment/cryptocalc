# CryptoCalc
 [Currency Converter DApp](https://cryptocalc.app "CryptoCalc")



## Mission

> To create a decentralized, open source DApp that allows you to convert any currency (digital or fiat).



## Summary

CryptoCalc is a MIT-licensed open source project built with the [SSPWA Template](https://sspw.app "Interact with the SSPWA Template") using Vue.js, Solidity smart contracts, and Golang microservices. End the frustration over how long it takes to convert one currency to another. The process can be excruciatingly slow when you are researching digital or crypto currencies, especially when you must start with one currency and convert it to multiple currencies before getting to the final currency. The CryptoCalc DApp will do that for you on the fly!

Enter your starting currency and amount to get started. Easily create a chain of currency conversions and calculate the final amount in any currency you choose. You can even add gas fees when converting one crypto or fiat currency to another. Use this app to quickly calculate the profit of potential investment opportunities. You will even be able to add stock trades on the NYSE to your chain of conversions.



## Architecture

##### v0.1.1 - ~~create new Truffle project~~

##### v0.1.2 - ~~create new Go project~~


## Version One


#### v1.0 - Phase Zero

##### v1.0.1 - ~~create SSPWA scaffolding for DApp~~

##### v1.0.2 - ~~create Truffle scaffolding for smart contracts (allows you to connect your wallet and pull currency values through oracles)~~

##### v1.0.3 - ~~create Go scaffolding for conversions microservice (allows you to save conversion chains and use them again)~~

#### v1.1 - Phase One

##### v1.1.1 - ~~refactor UI/UX in calculator view so it looks good on all devices~~

##### v1.1.2 - ~~refactor logic for vuex state so wallet and contract interaction flows correctly~~

##### v1.1.3 - ~~create logic and UI/UX to install and connect MetaMask wallet to Kovan testnet before being able to calculate conversion~~

#### v1.2 - Phase Two

##### v1.2.1 - ~~add ability to deploy to mainnet in Truffle scaffolding~~

##### v1.2.2 - ~~switch from Kovan testnet feed to mainnet feed in conversions smart contract~~

##### v1.2.3 - ~~deploy to mainnet and connect SSPWA to new contract~~

#### v1.3 - Phase Three

##### v1.3.1 - ~~create CI/CD pipeline for project~~

##### v1.3.2 - create test cases for project

##### v1.3.3 - create documentation for project

#### v1.4 - Phase Four

##### v1.4.1 - create logic and UI/UX to add currencies to currency selector dynamically

##### v1.4.2 - create logic and UI/UX to add another conversion to conversion chain

##### v1.4.3 - create logic and UI/UX to save conversion chains via conversions microservice

##### v1.4.4 - create logic and UI/UX to view, use, and edit saved conversion chains
